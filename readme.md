# Leaderboard for 711dubs

This is a fully functional leaderboard for the drinking game 711dubs. You can add a new player, update the standings after a game, and view the leaderboard and statistics in real time. The leaderboard is not hosted anywhere and is locally setup for each session. Currently it's close to halloween so the leaderboard is themed accordingly. Cheers! 🍾
